        "Short Summary": "The main character of the series, Monkey D. Luffy, is introduced as a child, with his role model, Shanks. After Shanks comes into conflict with a mountain bandit at a bar, it is revealed that Luffy accidentally ate a Devil Fruit, the Gomu Gomu no Mi. Later on, after Luffy provokes Higuma, he is taken hostage. Shanks and his crew show up and defeat Higuma's bandits, but Higuma escapes, taking Luffy on a boat. After Higuma kicks Luffy into the water, a Sea King appears and eats Higuma, and Shanks arrives just in time to save Luffy's life.

Before Shanks leaves, he gives Luffy his straw hat. Ten years later, Luffy officially sets sail as a pirate and begins the adventure to fulfill his dream of becoming the Pirate King.",
        "Long Summary": "A man is handcuffed and in front of him there are two other men with swords, crossing into an \"X\". There was once a man who took everything in the world: wealth, fame and power, known as Pirate King Gold Roger. The pirate's last words drove people throughout the world to the sea. Roger announces that if someone wants his treasure he or she can have it, saying that he left everything \"there\". Roger is executed, and the entire crowd, including a man with a pirate symbol on his hand, is cheering. The world has entered the Golden Age of Piracy. In a small seaport village, a pirate ship landed almost one year ago. The east wind blows. It is a small peaceful village. A boy is standing on the ship's figurehead. A man asks Luffy what he is doing. The child's full name is revealed to be Monkey D. Luffy. He has a knife in his left hand and he is wearing a shirt with \"ANCHOR\" written on it. He announces that he is not joking this time as he had enough, and he decides to prove it for everyone. The man is wearing a straw hat and he tells Luffy to go for it to see what he is going to do. Another man claims that the kid is going to do something funny again. The child stabs himself with the knife right under his eye, screaming in pain. All the pirates are surprised because of this. The first man shouts asking Luffy what he is doing. In the village, the pirates and the boy have gathered in the Partys Bar. A pirate proposes to drink and celebrate to Luffy's craziness and to their greatness. Inside the bar, all the men are drinking and eating. A fat man is drinking straight from a barrel of beer. A monkey can be seen dancing in the background. One of the pirates laughs and tells everyone to drink. Another man asks to bring him more sake. Two other men are fighting over a piece of meat. The first one calls the other one an idiot and claims that it is his meat. The second one tells the first to shut up claiming that it is his. A third man tells both of them to stop because it is shameful to fight while they are drunk. Luffy is now patched up, but he is almost crying, claiming that it did not hurt. The man with the straw hat calls the boy a liar and tells him to not do something so stupid again. The child boasts that he is not afraid of pain and asks the man to bring him to the sea the next time because he also wants to be a pirate. The man claims that Luffy is not ready to be a pirate, explaining that not being able to swim is a pirate's greatest weakness. The man is revealed to be the pirate leader called \"Red-Haired Shanks\". The boy boasts that he will be fine as long as he stays on the board and that his fighting is good, saying that he has trained and that his punch is as strong as pistol fire. Shanks doubts Luffy's latter claim in a bored tone. The child gets angry at the man because of his tone. Many of the pirates are standing in a line, dancing with the fat man from before in the middle. A man on his left is wearing a kerchief with \"Yasopp\" written on it. One of the men observes that Luffy is unhappy. Another tells him to be happy to face anything. Another affirms that the life of a pirate is great. Another tells him that the sea is very wide, so he can go to any island and adventure. Another claims that nothing is greater than freedom. Luffy is fascinated with the pirates' words. Shanks requests that the men do not give the boy dumb ideas. The fat man argues that it is the truth. Another man confirms. Another pirate suggests to the captain that they take the child one time, since it is not a big deal. Another man and Luffy agree. Shanks orders that next time one of his subordinates shall get off the ship and let the boy replace him. Hearing this, the men turn away, while one of them comments that they said enough and that they should drink. Luffy gets angry and asks the group what kind of friends they are. Shanks claims that the most important thing is that the child is still too young and that he will reconsider taking him in ten years. The kid boasts that he is a man. The red-haired man calms him down and gives him a glass of juice. The boy happily accepts and drinks it. Shanks starts laughing and crying proving that Luffy is still a kid. Luffy is angry at the trick. Luffy becomes depressed that Shanks does not let him join the crew despite the fact that the boy cut himself today. The bartender can be seen in the background. A smoking man tries to explain to Luffy that he should try to understand the captain's feelings since he is their leader. The man continues and says that the captain knows that the life of a pirate is interesting, but it is also very dangerous. A wanted poster of Mikio Itoo can be seen in the background on a wall. The man claims that his captain does not purposely tease the boy's ambition of becoming a pirate. Luffy thinks Shanks is not taking him serious, which Shanks proves by mocking him again. The bartender observes that the red-haired man is very happy. Shanks replies that making fun of the boy is his joy. Luffy suggests again to the smoking man that the captain is not taking him seriously. The bartender's name is revealed to be Makino. She holds a barrel of beer and asks the kid if he wants to eat. Luffy claims that he will pay with his treasure. Shanks doubts the existence of Luffy's treasure and calls him a liar. The boy denies, saying that he will become a pirate and pay her with the treasure he finds. Makino replies that she will be waiting and the kid starts laughing. Luffy is waiting with a fork and knife in his hands. Finally, Makino brings Luffy and Shanks their meals. As the boy is struggling to bite in a big piece of meat, he raises the question of how long the crew will be staying. The red-haired man comments that it has been almost a year since they have made the town their base, so he is thinking of taking a few more trips and then leave and head north. Luffy manages to bite in his piece of meat. Luffy is thinking for a moment, and Makino looks at him, almost feeling sorry for the child. As the bartender is washing some dishes, Luffy boasts that he will learn how to swim by then, and Shanks wishes him good luck. Suddenly, a man kicks down one of the doors of the bar. The whole place goes silent. The man enters the bar along with a group behind him and excuses himself. He observes the group partying, and mentions that it is his first time seeing pirates, remaining unimpressed. The fat man and the smoking man are unfazed by this sudden appearance. Meanwhile, Luffy is eating a strange fruit and is confused. The strange man walks towards the bartender, as Shanks is sitting nearby and holding a bottle of sake. The men behind him are all wearing similar looking outfits. He claims that they are bandits and that they are not there to cause trouble, since they only want to buy ten barrels of sake. The man is revealed to be the leader of the bandits, called Higuma. However, Makino tells the bandit that the bar is out of alcohol. The man looks back toward the pirates, thinking it is strange, and asks what are the other men drinking. He sarcastically asks if it is water. The bartender confirms that the pirates are drinking sake, but that is all which is left. Shanks is sorry for the man because his group drank all the alcohol, so he offers him the last bottle that he was holding earlier. Higuma looks displeased, so he smashes the bottle, breaking it into pieces and spilling the sake on the red-haired man. Luffy gets down from his seat that was near Shanks. Makino is frightened at the situation, while the bandits are amused. The smoking man is unfazed, and the boy is surprised. The bandit leader is unsatisfied of one bottle and asks the pirate if he is unaware of the bandit's reputation. The red-haired man is upset that the floor is all wet. Higuma brings out his wanted poster of 8,000,000, claiming that he is one of the prime fugitives there, since he killed 56 people and tells Shanks to not mess with him again because mountain bandits and pirates do not have good relationships. The red-haired pirate ignores the bandit, picks up a large piece of the bottle from the ground, tells Makino that he is sorry for the mess and asks her for a mop, saying that he will clean. Higuma takes out his sword and cuts the table along with the plates on it, saying that since the red-haired man enjoys cleaning, he can now enjoy it more. Convinced that Shanks is a coward, Higuma leaves the bar. Outside, two citizens are seen hiding behind a building. Convinced that the town is pathetic, since it does not even have alcohol, the bandit leader decides to go to the next town. Afterwards, as Makino tries to see if the red-haired man is hurt, Shanks and his crew laugh at his humiliation. The fat man thinks that the captain looked very silly. Angered by their attitude, Luffy asks the group why they are laughing, since the situation was very disgraceful. The kid thinks they should have fought the bandits, despite the fact that they had more people. The boy thinks that someone that laughs after getting picked on is not a man, nor a pirate. Shanks tells Luffy that he understands his feelings, but there is no reason to get worked up over a bottle of alcohol. As Luffy turns to go away, Shanks grabs his arm to stop him and tells him to stay. However the boy tells him that he doesn't want to see him again, since he is a coward. As the kid moves away, his arm stretches, to everyone's surprise, including the kerchief man. The fat man looks into a box and everyone is surprised, saying that the Gomu Gomu no Mi that they got from an enemy ship is not there. The fat man is sweating and shows Luffy a drawing of the fruit he was eating earlier, and asks him if he ate that. Luffy affirms, asking if that was not dessert, although it tasted badly. Shanks goes in front of the boy and explains that that was the Gomu Gomu no Mi, one of the devil fruits and one of the rarest treasures in the sea, that anyone who eats it turns into a rubber human and will never be able to swim. Luffy is surprised and Shanks calls him an idiot. Later, Luffy visits UO to buy some fish. The store keeper and his wife are happy to see the boy. The store owner says that he looks happy, asks him if the pirates left him behind again and mentions that the kid can not swim anymore. Luffy claims that he is going to be a pirate that doesn't fall into the sea. The boy stretches his cheeks, making them look like a big smile and he claims that he became happier after eating the Gomu Gomu no Mi. An old man asks what is so good about having a rubber body. He complains that everyone in the town thinks that Luffy's new ability is cool, but he does not understand the usefulness of it. The boy calls him the chief. The old man is standing on a crane, and tries to persuade the kid to not become a pirate since it would ruin the town's reputation. He insists that despite the fact that the captain looks like a reasonable person, Luffy should not hang around him anymore. Later, the doors at the Partys Bar are fixed. The boy and Makino are staying there alone, while the bartender is cleaning a glass. Makino mentions that the pirates have been out for a while and asks him if he misses them. Luffy replies that he does not because he has not forgiven them for the bandit incident yet. As the boy is playing with a glass that only contains a few cubes of ice, he claims that he overestimated Shanks. Luffy thought that the red-haired man was a tough pirate, so he is disappointed. Makino thinks that people that can stand up after getting picked on are brave. The boy tells her that she does not understand, since there are times when men must fight back, so the bartender confirms that she does not understand, and Luffy affirms again. Suddenly, a man enters the bar and excuses himself. Luffy is surprised, the man is revealed to be Higuma and he enters the bar along with his group of bandits. He observes that the pirates are not there, so the bar is quiet. The entire group sit at the tables, while the boy and the girl keep looking at them. The bandit leader asks her what is she waiting for, saying that there are customers and orders her to bring them sake. Soon afterward, Makino rushes through the village to find the Mayor because Luffy has gotten himself into a hostage situation with Higuma after the bandit said something that angered him. As Makino and the Mayor return to reason with the bandit, the bandit states that it is already too late because Luffy is going to die. As Higuma raises his sword to kill Luffy, Shanks and his crew reappear. Higuma and his men tell them that it is none of their business. As Shanks walks forward, one of the bandits points a gun at Shanks, only to be shot by Lucky Roux. Shanks tells Higuma that he will not allow him to hurt a friend of his and get away with it. Higuma, unfazed by his speech, sends the rest of the crew after him. Beckman decides to step in and single-handedly takes out the entire gang of bandits, leaving Higuma alone. Realizing he cannot win, Higuma drops a smoke bomb and takes Luffy away. As the smoke clears, Shanks realizes Luffy is gone and panics. Out at sea, Higuma and Luffy stand in a boat. Higuma decides it is time to lose Luffy and kicks him into the water. Angry that he could not do anything to Higuma, Luffy struggles in the water as a Sea King appears. The Sea King eats Higuma, who is unable to do anything to defend himself, before turning toward Luffy. Moments before Luffy is eaten, Shanks saves his life and scares away the Sea King with a stare. When the Sea King is gone, Luffy begins crying upon realizing Shanks has lost his left arm in saving his life. Finally, Luffy realizes he is too young to sail out to sea and become a pirate, as well as what a great man Shanks is. Later at the docks, Luffy says goodbye to Shanks and his crew and admits he is sad that they are leaving, but is not worried about going with them because he has decided he will become a pirate on his own. This leads to Shanks stating that he did not want him on his crew in the first place before claiming that there is no way Luffy can become a pirate. Luffy angrily proclaims he will become a pirate, gather a crew strong enough to beat Shanks', find the world's greatest treasure, and become the Pirate King no matter what. Happy about Luffy's decision, Shanks gives him his straw hat and tells Luffy to give it back when he has become a great pirate. Honored by Shanks's gesture, Luffy cries. As Shanks boards his ship to leave, Beckman comments on how Luffy will become big. Shanks admits that he knows Luffy will because he reminds him of himself when he was young. Ten years later, Luffy leaves the village to start his own pirate crew and become the Pirate King.",

        "Long Summary": "Luffy sets off in a dinghy to form his own pirate crew; however, no sooner had he left than he ran into his first problem - a whirlpool. Meanwhile, on a remote island, as Alvida is inspecting her ship, she clobbers one of her crew for leaving dust on the deck and asks Koby \"Who is the most beautiful in all the sea?\" The boy fearfully replies that she is. She comments on how Koby is only allowed to stay because he knows more about navigation than all the others do and how useless he is at everything else. She then orders Koby to clean her shoes. Sad and upset, Koby pushes a barrel he found into Alvida's hideout. Upon approach, three of Alvida's crew (Heppoko, Peppoko, and Poppoko) stop him and take the barrel, bullying him into being silent about the fact that they are going to drink the wine inside it without Alvida knowing. Suddenly, Luffy bursts out of the barrel and shocks everyone. Before they can get their answer as to why he popped out, Alvida sends her club flying into the hideout. Koby and Luffy flee; meanwhile Alvida accuses her crew of slacking off because she heard someone call \"Aw! What a nice nap!\" They explain it was not them, but an intruder instead. Alvida fears the famous bounty hunter Roronoa Zoro is here to claim her bounty. Elsewhere, Koby has dragged Luffy to safety away from Alvida. He shows him his boat that he made over the last 2 years in an attempt to escape from her and explains how he got into his situation. Luffy comments on how wimpy Koby is. Luffy tells Koby his dream to become Pirate King. Koby cannot believe Luffy is prepared to die for his dream and Luffy hits Koby because he does not like his wimpy outlook. Koby admires Luffy's outlook on life. Koby then reveals his desires to become a Marine and catch bad guys. He boasts he would rather die trying to escape to join them than spend the rest of his life at Alvida's side. Just then, Alvida appears and destroys his boat. Alvida accuses Koby of hiring someone to kill her. When she asks him who the most beautiful woman is, Luffy interferes and outwardly states Alvida is an ugly old hag. Koby, inspired by Luffy, tells Alvida straight what he thinks of her. Alvida strikes Koby in anger, but Luffy gets between her and Koby, taking the full force of Alvida's club; to the shock of everyone, he survives. With one punch of his \"Gomu Gomu no Pistol\", Luffy knocks Alvida out and orders her crew to fetch Koby a boat and to stay out of his way. Sometime later, Luffy and Koby are seen sailing out to sea by themselves. Koby tells Luffy more about Zoro, the bounty hunter Alvida mentioned. Luffy decides that he wants to try to recruit Zoro and they head off.",

Despite the fact that Zoro is seen as being a demon, Luffy is insistent on having him on his crew, and goes to meet him. There, he and Koby meet Rika, a young girl that Zoro protected, causing him to be imprisoned.",
        "Long Summary": "Out at sea, Koby and Luffy are discussing Luffy's decision to recruit Zoro. Sometime later, they arrive at the Marine base Zoro is being held at. Luffy is surprised that they actually arrived, and Koby points out that these are the basics of navigation. Koby points out that Luffy can not just float around out at sea and that he must find a navigator soon. Luffy then says they should go eat. At a restaurant, when Koby and Luffy discuss parting ways, Luffy mentions Zoro's name with shocking results from the other customers. When Koby mentions the name of the Marine in charge of the base, Morgan, the same effect occurs. In the street Koby comments on the reactions for the villagers here in the town, understanding why they reacted out of fear for Zoro due to his reputation, but not Morgan's name. At the Marine base, after Luffy climbs up the wall to see Zoro, he climbs up another part of the wall to get a better view of someone he saw in the base. Koby also climbs up, but falls down again out of fear after sighting Zoro. Zoro offers the two the head of a bounty carrier if they will free him due to him going without food for 9 days. As they talk with Zoro, Rika suddenly appears next to them as she climbs using a ladder, hushing them to be quiet. Rika climbs over the wall; Koby beckons her to come back as she walks towards Zoro. She offers him some onigiri since he has not eaten in several days. Zoro refuses and tells her to go away. Just then, Morgan's son, Helmeppo, appears with a few Marines and starts mocking Zoro. He snatches the rice balls from Rika and eats one of them. However, he soon spits it out due to the fact she made them using sugar instead of salt. He knocks them to the ground and stomps on them, much to Koby's shock at seeing someone affiliated with the Marines do such a cruel thing. She cries, lamenting on how she worked hard to make them. Helmeppo then points out the law made by his father, which states that anyone who assists a prisoner will also be found guilty of the crimes the prisoner has committed. Helmeppo says that since she is a child, she will be let off the hook. He then orders one of the Marines to toss her over the wall. When he refuses, he reminds them who his father is and the Marine throws her over the wall, forcing Luffy to catch her. Helmeppo continues to mock Zoro, but Zoro remains strong about his situation. After Helmeppo is gone, Luffy talks to Zoro about joining his crew. Zoro states that he will not join a pirate crew and become a criminal as he has his own dream to follow. After they finish talking, Zoro asks Luffy to give him the rice balls to eat despite the state they are now in. He then tells Luffy to tell Rika that he ate them all and that they were tasty. Later, Luffy explains how Zoro ate the rice balls and enjoyed them to Rika. Koby is surprised at how considerate Zoro was, despite the reputation he holds. She explains that Zoro is not a bad person and that he was arrested for killing Helmeppo's pet wolf, Soro, while defending her from him, as Soro was running wild, terrorizing the town at the time. As Rika finishes explaining the story, Helmeppo appears bragging about going back on his promise to Zoro and says that he plans on having him killed in three days. Luffy hits him out of anger and after Helmeppo runs away, Luffy decides Zoro is joining his crew.",

        "Short Summary": "Luffy again goes to see Zoro to invite him to his crew, and Zoro refuses. Luffy decides that if he gets Zoro's swords back from Helmeppo, then he can make Zoro join before he gives them back, so he rushes off to retrieve them. Meanwhile, Morgan, the captain of the Marine base, is having his men lift a giant statue of himself, which Luffy inadvertently destroys while trying to get the swords back. Morgan, infuriated, orders his men to capture Luffy so that he can kill him.",
        "Long Summary": "Helmeppo is angry at Luffy for hitting him. Koby can barely hold Luffy back and the townsfolk are in awe at Luffy's actions. Helmeppo is dragged away by two Marines, claiming Luffy will die for hitting him. Rika is pulled away by Ririka, her mother, but Rika defends Luffy and Zoro as good men. Luffy tells Koby he is going to speak to Zoro again. Back at the Marine base, one of the Marines reports to Morgan that the amount of offering from the townsfolk is decreasing. Morgan is unable to accept that they are poor, seeing it as a sign that the townsfolk are disrespecting him. Just then, Helmeppo bursts in and tells his father that he wants someone killed. Luffy arrives to talk to Zoro about him joining his crew. He makes a deal with Zoro without his consent that if he gets him his swords, he must join his crew. On the roof, a statue of Morgan is being raised. Helmeppo is still demanding that Morgan kill Luffy; however, he is hit for giving Morgan an order. Morgan mentions that he heard a little girl snuck into the base earlier. He orders Lieutenant Junior Grade Rokkaku to go find and kill her for disrespecting him. When the Marine refuses, he is hit. Morgan then claims he will do it himself, and gives the order to raise the statue. On ground level, while Luffy is trying to find a Marine to get Zoro's swords, he hears someone on the roof. On the roof, Seaman Recruit Ukkari knocks the statue against part of the building on the roof. Luffy launches himself up onto the roof via \"Gomu Gomu no Rocket\". As the Marine is about to be punished for knocking the statue, Luffy flies by, grabbing some of the ropes on the statue because he has taken off into the air too fast. To the horror of everyone there, the statue breaks. Morgan suddenly bursts out Luffy's death sentence and Helmeppo points out that Luffy was the one he wanted his father to kill in the first place. Then Luffy drags Helmeppo into the base building to find Zoro's swords, while one of the Marines spots Koby untying Zoro. Morgan becomes paranoid because he thinks the townsfolk are turning on him. Koby reveals to Zoro his desire to become a Marine who is just, as well as Luffy's dream of becoming Pirate King. While Zoro shows surprise for Luffy's ambition, Koby is suddenly shot. This causes Zoro to threateningly glance at the roof of the Marine base.",

Zoro is thinking about how he cannot die at a place like this, remembering the promise he made to his childhood friend, Kuina. Just before Zoro and Koby are shot, however, Luffy gets in the way, protecting the pair from all the bullets. Zoro realizes that, if he wants to live, he has no choice and tells Luffy that he will join him.",
        "Long Summary": "Luffy is busy dragging Helmeppo through the base, trying to find Zoro's sword. After dragging Helmeppo for a while, Luffy asks Helmeppo where Zoro's sword is and he tells Luffy Zoro's arsenal is in his room. Luffy decides to use Helmeppo as a human shield, leaving some pursuing Marines in a position where they cannot do anything. Meanwhile, Koby realizes that he has been shot and that he had started bleeding. Zoro tells Koby to run, but Koby will not go until Zoro is untied. He tells Zoro that Helmeppo never planned to keep his word. Zoro cannot believe what he is hearing, and Koby tells Zoro how Luffy punched Helmeppo because of what they overheard him say. Koby asks Zoro to help Luffy. Suddenly, some Marines approach Zoro and Koby and declare them traitors. Elsewhere, Luffy has found swords in Helmeppo's room, but does not know which one is Zoro's. Luffy suddenly spots what is going on down on the ground outside the window of the Marine base. Zoro and Koby are in trouble and Morgan wants them dead. Zoro, aware that he may die, begins a flashback to his days as a young boy and his reasons for becoming who he is. A young Zoro was in a training dojo on the ground after a defeat against Kuina. Kuina was mocking him for failing to win against her (for the 2000th time) even after he used two swords. Zoro's friends stuck up for him when he was called weak, as Kuina stated even though he could stand up to the adults, it was no good if he still could not beat her. The others accused her for showing off because she was the dojo master's daughter. As the sensei entered the room, the other trainee swordsmen (save Zoro himself) accused him of giving her special training because she was able to beat Zoro. The sensei just stated that Kuina was older. Later that night, a frustrated Zoro challenged Kuina to fight him with real katana. Kuina accepted Zoro's challenge. With one strike, Zoro lost and Kuina claimed her 2001st victory against him. After the duel was over, Kuina broke down in tears. She told Zoro her woe about being a girl: as she gets older, she will fall behind him due to the fact girls do not acquire the strength guys do. Kuina said that she wished she had been born a boy, but Zoro got angry at her, saying that she did not have the right to complain after she beat him. Zoro went further by saying that it was an insult to all the hard work he'd been doing. The two then made an agreement; one of them will become the greatest swordsman in the world. Disaster hit the next day as Zoro was informed of the worst; Kuina had fallen down the stairs and died. Upset, Zoro called to her body lying lifeless, its face covered with a cloth, accusing her of running away. Zoro asked the sensei to give Zoro her sword; he will become the world's greatest swordsman on her behalf. Back in the present, Zoro faces death. As the Marines fire, Luffy jumps in front of them and the bullets hit him instead. The bullets then bounce off Luffy to the disbelief of everyone watching. Luffy brings the three swords he had found in Helmeppo's room, claiming he did not know which one was Zoro's. The swordsman then explains he uses three swords. Zoro accepts Luffy's offer to join his crew because he would rather become a criminal than die.",

He lays down the conditions for him to join Luffy, warning him that his plans have better not interfere with his own dream of becoming the greatest swordsman.

Morgan proves to have high endurance as neither man manages to knock the other to the ground. As Morgan is knocked around by Luffy, Helmeppo holds a gun to Koby's head and threatens to kill him.

Zoro questions why Koby is worried since he is not going with them. He replies that it is because they are friends. Zoro points out to Koby that his past with Alvida makes joining the Marines difficult as he has association with pirates. Just then, the Marines enter the building demanding to know if Luffy and Zoro are pirates. After the pair confirms that they are, they are told as pirates the Marines are grateful for their help, but they cannot stay in town and must leave; however, the Marines will not be reporting the whole event to Marine Headquarters.

        "Long Summary": "Zoro and Luffy are lost, starving at sea due to the fact that neither of them has any navigation skills. They are talking about how Zoro survives on the sea by hunting others. Zoro points how odd it is for a pirate like Luffy not being able to navigate, though Luffy states that wandering usually works for him. He then points out that Zoro is no different, given that he is a wandering bounty hunter. Zoro reveals that he never intended to become a bounty hunter in the first place when he first went out to sea, but entirely to search for a certain man. However, he then could not find his way back home. Due to this, he had no choice but to take up bounty hunting for a living. Luffy somewhat correctly comes to the conclusion that Zoro has been lost this whole time, which angers the swordsman who tells him to shut up. Some time passes and a bird flies overhead, causing a starving Luffy to go after it, which ends up with him in the bird's beak, being carried off with Zoro left to chase after him. As Zoro rows as fast as he can, he comes across some castaways and tells them to grab on, as he is not stopping. When they are on board, they reveal that they are pirates working for Captain Buggy and that they were taking the boat. Zoro then reveals to them who he is by beating them. As they row him onwards the question of why they were in the middle of the ocean arises. It turns out they were tricked by a girl on a boat, who stole their boat and treasure, leaving them to be sunk on her boat with help from a storm. Zoro wonders if a person like her who can predict the weather would join him and Luffy. One of Buggy's crew tells Zoro about their captain and how he has the power of a Devil Fruit. Meanwhile, a girl in the nearby town is running from some of Buggy's crew after stealing their map to the Grand Line. Elsewhere Buggy's men report seeing a strange bird and Buggy gives the order to shoot it down. As the bird is hit, Luffy falls right in front of the girl. However, to the shock of the Superhuman Domingos, Luffy stands up unscathed. The girl tries to claim Luffy is her boss in order to get out of trouble with the pirates and runs off, leaving Luffy to deal with them. One of Buggy's crew knocks Luffy's straw hat causing him to get mad. Luffy beats them up. After he is finished, the girl reappears claiming to be a thief who steals from pirates, called Nami.",

Nami asks Luffy what is so important about his hat that made him mad when Buggy's crew touched it, wondering if it had jewels or a treasure map inside. On the roof of a bar, Buggy is dealing with one of his crew members after Nami got away. Buggy mishears him, thinking that he said something about his nose being strange. The man is raised into the air via Buggy's Devil Fruit powers; Buggy orders the rest of the crew to put a cannon to the man and fire. With the man killed by cannon fire, Buggy orders everyone to search the town for the thief and any treasure to be found. In a house elsewhere, Nami asks Luffy about his crew's numbers. After knowing they were only two, she explains to Luffy who Buggy is and why the town is empty, as the populace is sheltering. She warns Luffy that Buggy is fond of using his cannon and that he once destroyed a whole town because a boy made fun of his nose. Nami gets fed up with Luffy's short attention span and tendency to ignore her. Nami reveals her quest to gather 100,000,000 and buy a village. She begins to talk about the plan she has for the Grand Line map she stole: she will go there and steal from all the famous pirates in that ocean, who she thinks must possess more treasure. Nami confirms she is a navigator and Luffy is excited about her joining in his adventure; however, when he tells her he is a pirate, she changes her mind. Nami reiterates her suspicion about the straw hat Luffy carries, thinking there must be a treasure map inside. Luffy tells her about the symbolic value of the hat, as it was given to him by his friend, to whom he swore he'd create a pirate crew. Nami explains she hates pirates the most, only liking mikan and money. However, as she now knows that Luffy does not have treasure or much intelligence, she suddenly has an idea. She agrees to join him if he comes with her to see Buggy. However, she takes some rope with her and as they approach his hideout, Nami ties Luffy up with it. Buggy is telling off his crew who believe they are about to be killed for not being able to find the thief who stole their map. They explain that, in their perception, with the thief, Nami, there was her boss, Luffy, who was the reason they couldn't retrieve the map. Just then Nami and Luffy enter the scene, to Buggy's surprise. Nami hands over Luffy, claiming she had an argument with her boss, and decides to pretend to join Buggy's crew, handing over the map she stole. Luffy is imprisoned in a cage. Elsewhere, Zoro arrives at the island with the pirates he encountered on the way, who explain that their crew is raiding the village at the moment. Zoro decides to meet Buggy to gather information about Luffy.",
